## What happens

[The Framework-for-Websites repo](https://github.com/khawkins98/allaboutken-framework) is an instantiation of [Foundation for Websites](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites).

Any changes you apply to the files inside the local `scss` and `js` directories <a href="https://travis-ci.org/EMBL-Design-Language/Framework-for-Websites">will be compiled by Travis CI</a> and served as:
- CSS: https://khawkins98.github.io/allaboutken-framework/css/allaboutken-framework.css
- JS: https://khawkins98.github.io/allaboutken-framework/js/allaboutken-framework.js
